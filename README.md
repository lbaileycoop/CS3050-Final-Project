# CS3050-Final-Project

## TODO
- Implement computer AI turn
- Implement tile trade-in
- Implement turn skip
- Implement the `validate_turn()` function in `board.py`, including:
    1. Ensuring words are placed in a straight line
    2. Ensuring words are connected to other played words (except for first turn)
    3. Getting ALL words created, in the case that 2 or more are created in a single turn
    4. Validating all words against the dictionary
    5. Properly calculating score (the current implementation does not work)
    6. Dealing with blank tiles
- Add difficulty and (optional) background options menu: could be in start screen or a settings menu
- (optional) add sound
